# Memory Expansion Design ReadMe

This document outlines the memory expansion design starting from address 60000h, including the addition of specific memory modules in a sequential order.

## Description

The memory expansion involves adding 2 modules of 64KB and 2 modules of 128KB to the existing memory, starting from address 60000h. The arrangement of these modules follows this sequence: 64KB - 64KB - 128KB - 128KB.

## File Contents

### 1. Calculations

Include detailed calculations showing the address allocation for each memory module added, demonstrating the starting addresses and their respective ranges.

### 2. Table

A table showcasing the memory layout, displaying the starting address, module size, and the range of addresses occupied by each module.

### 3. Design Overview

Provide an overview of the design process, explaining how the memory expansion was planned and implemented. Discuss any considerations, constraints, or special configurations that were taken into account during the design.

## Usage

Open this file to understand the memory expansion layout and its sequence. Use it as a reference for memory addressing and module allocation.

## Notes

- Ensure proper understanding and validation of memory address calculations before implementation.
- Any changes to the memory layout or module configuration should be appropriately documented and validated.
- This file serves as documentation and a reference guide for the memory expansion design.
